/**
 * Background task for execution in steps.
 * A background task can get executed in parallel to the display of a step. In case the background task is finished
 * before the user closes the step with any of the buttons, the user consent must translate the result of the task
 * ([StepActionResult]) to a result of the step ([org.openecard.gui.StepResult]) and return it to the caller
 * of the navigators function (e.g. [UserConsentNavigator.next]). In case the step is closed by the user, then
 * the background task is aborted and the usual procedure is followed.
